    <h1>Thor Odinson</h1>
    <p>
      "Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the
      Asgardians, <br />
      a group of humanoid beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm
      Eternal.<br />
      Thor is the son of Odin, the All-Father and king of Asgard. <br />He was
      worshiped by the humans known as Vikings and became part of Norse
      Mythology.<br />
      Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to channel
      his godly energies, <br />he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten
      Realms. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior became too much,<br />
      Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth) as a disabled
      mortal medical student named Donald Blake, stripped of his memory.<br />
      After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly
      powers.<br />
      Thor went on to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the
      founding members of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
